## Overview

This Blockchain Voting System leverages blockchain technology to provide a transparent and secure voting mechanism. By utilizing Solidity for the smart contract and ReactJS for the front end, this application offers a user-friendly and trustless environment, with each vote permanently stored on the blockchain.

## Features

- **Secure Voting**: Each vote is recorded on the blockchain, ensuring tamper-proof results.
- **Transparency**: Votes are publicly verifiable, adding transparency to the voting process.
- **Decentralization**: The system does not rely on a central authority, eliminating single points of failure.
- **Real-time Updates**: The React front end provides users with immediate feedback on voting status.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following tools installed:

- **Node.js** (v14 or later)
- **NPM** (v6 or later)
- **Hardhat**: Ethereum development environment
- **MetaMask**: Browser extension to interact with Ethereum blockchain
- **Volta Test Network** or any Ethereum test network

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```shell
